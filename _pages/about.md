Dr Bang Du obtained his PhD from the University of Galway, Ireland, in March 2024. He then joined the University of Surrey as a Research Fellow in Bioinformatics and Anaerobic Digestion Microbiome Modelling, and serves as a Lecturer in Civil and Environmental Engineering. He is currently leading a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship project and has contributed to several national and international research projects funded by UKRI-EPSRC, Science Foundation Ireland, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Dr Du has published serveral peer-reviewed journal papers, such as Water Research.

His research focuses on valorisation and energy recovery from anaerobic waste and wastewater treatment, particularly in:
- applying ecological theory in microbial enrichment and metabolic pathway regulation with engineering approaches, and 
- integrating thermodynamic-kinetic-microbiome models to reveal the dynamics of microorganisms, substrates, energy, and electrons in biological treatment.
